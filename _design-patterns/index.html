<dl>
	<dt>1. Individual elements in a single group are well defined to work well independantly</dt>
	<dd>Any of methods elements should be able to independatly be pieced together to form a group that works well by itself. An example is a widget, or a card, a sidebar, or a form.</dd>

	<dt>2. Individual groups are well defined to work well together when mixed</dt>
	<dd>These indivual groups should be able to combine together in a modular fashion without alteration to create new views, pages, and even apps. ex: the subheader, or width of one element in a group should not throw off another group.</dd>

	<dt>3. The mixing of individual and groups of elements is thoroughly thought through</dt>
	<dd>When deciding to add a new type of subheader, or grouping of items (dropdown, card list), we need to think through it’s possible application and combination throughout the entire style guide to adhere to #1 and #2.</dd>

	<dt>4. It’s hard to break the system.</dt>
	<dd>In adhering to #1-#3, it should be difficult for someone to piece together a view that’s difficult to navigate, and who’s UI is inconsistant throughout the style guide. If the design system is breaking, it will be very evident.</dd>

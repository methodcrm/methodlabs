	<dt>1. Maintain consistancy</dt>
	<dd>People expect what they see on desktop to be what they see on mobile. Maintain a state of not changing the styling or functional interactions of elements or of the UI / UX between mobile and desktop.</dd>

	<dt>2. Designing modules responsively.</dt>
	<dd>When designing for either desktop, we still think in mobile as the modular constructs that make up a desktop appâ€™s design should be accessible and be able to live independatly as individual pieces that fit a phone.</dd>

	<dt>3. Designing responsively to give users the best experience per device.</dt>
	<dd>When designing modules responsively, groups of modules should be adaptive to give an excellent user experience per device since we treat the browser as a fully collapsable viewport.</dd>

	<dt>4. Limitation of functionality is OK</dt>
	<dd>At the end of the day, users can still expect functional limits driven by technical limitations, Methods decision making in cost effective limitations</dd>
